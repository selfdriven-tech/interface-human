# The Human Interface

- Your data - protected 
- Collective engagement - community / organisation.
- Human verification
- Discoverability - supporting human/practition in the loop

### Design Principles
- Keep data protected as close to the human as possible
- Establish identity and trust using SSI
- Share the minimum required to help with collective organisation. ie as required by a community.

### Interface Generation

- Classify the data - Private (Default) or Public.
- Protect the data - Encrypt or Hash depending on Classification.
- Store the data.

### entityOS

selfdriven uses the entityOS SDK to support human, device and cloud storage interfaces.
